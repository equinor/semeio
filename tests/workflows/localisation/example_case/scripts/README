### Source code scripts

- `common_functions.py`:  Functions used by the two scripts make_reference_data.py and sim_fields.py
- `make_reference_data.py`:
    - Create grid files, random seed file localisation config file and observation files for the test cases
    - Create reference data (assuming the ERT and localistion code is correct and updated)
- `sim_fields.py`:
    - Used as forward model in ERT
    - Simulate the GRF field, upscale it, extract responses (predictions) of observations.

- `FM_SIM_FIELD`: ERT configuration of forward model SIM_FIELD using sim_fields.py.
