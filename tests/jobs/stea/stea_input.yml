# The stea web client works by *adjusting* the profiles in an existing
# stea project which has already been defined. That implies that all
# profiles added in this configuration file should already be part of
# the project. To match the profiles specified here with the profiles in
# the project we must give a id for the profiles.

# The profiles keyword is used to enter profile data explicitly in the
# configuration file. Each profile is identified with an id from the
# existing stea project, a start date and the actual data.

# Profiles which are calculated directly from an eclipse simulation are
# listed with the ecl-profiles key. Each profile is identified with an id
# from the stea project and an eclipe key like 'FOPT'. By default the stea
# client will calculate a profile from the full time range of the simulated
# data, but you can optionally use the keywords start-year and end-year to
# limit the time range.
