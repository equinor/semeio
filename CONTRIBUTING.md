   and ask for a code review

### Documentation

Because semeio automatically adds documentation to ert, if any changes to the documentation hooks are
performed, the ert documentation should be built to make sure no errors are introduced.

You can build the documentation after installation by running
```bash
git clone https://github.com/equinor/ert
cd ert
pip install -e .
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
sphinx-build -n -v -E -W ./docs/rst/manual ./tmp/ert_docs
```
and then open the generated `./tmp/ert_docs/index.html` in a browser.
